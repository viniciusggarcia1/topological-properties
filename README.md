Outline
This code was created to plot some graphs using a given Hamiltonian.
The code is organized in two files: qsh.py and main.py. The qsh.py contains functions that are used in the main code (main.py). In order to get some results you can execute de main.py using python3, for example, and you'll have to enter the hopping term and the topological mass. The Hamiltonian was implemented directly in the code, however can be easily changed. In this version the Hamiltonian has to be 2x2.
